---++ Installation

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

---++ Known issues

as of wkhtmltopdf-0.8.3

   * links don't work even local #anchors don't do it; they are only drawn viually; [[http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/issues/detail?id=39][bug report]]
   * the =&lt;base href="... />= html header must occur _before_ any other js or css files in the html source;
     relative urls before are not resolved correctly (this is a general webkit problem &ndash; not a wkhtmltopdf issue)
   * there's no way to provide a base url on the command-line if a =&lt;base ...>= tag is missing in the html source
   * a couple of important css3 features are not implemented yet, e.g. =::after=, =::before=, =leader()=, =target-counter()=, =@page=, =string-set=, =title=, =chapter=, =hyphens=
