This plugin generates PDF using the [[http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/][Webkit rendering engine]].

---++ Usage

Get a PDF by adding =contenttype=application/pdf= to the view url like this:
<verbatim class="tml">
%SCRIPTURL{"view"}/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?contenttype=application/pdf
</verbatim>

Here's the complete Foswiki documentation in [[%SCRIPTURL{"view"}%/%SYSTEMWEB%/CompleteDocumentation?contenttype=application/pdf][PDF]].

---++ Installation

Download =wkhtmltopdf= from http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/ matching your platform and install it into the =tools/= directory of your 
Foswiki installation. In case you installed it somewhere else use =configure= to point to the proper location.

---++ Known issues

as of wkhtmltopdf-0.9.1

   * anchors still don't work: acroread throws a security exception

as of wkhtmltopdf-0.8.3

   * links don't work even local #anchors don't do it; they are only drawn viually; [[http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/issues/detail?id=39][bug report]]
   * the =&lt;base href="... />= html header must occur _before_ any other js or css files in the html source;
     relative urls before are not resolved correctly (this is a general webkit problem &ndash; not a wkhtmltopdf issue)
   * there's no way to provide a base url on the command-line if a =&lt;base ...>= tag is missing in the html source
   * a couple of important css3 features are not implemented yet, e.g. =::after=, =::before=, =leader()=, =target-counter()=, =@page=, =string-set=, =title=, =chapter=, =hyphens=
